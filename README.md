# ZillaKranti
Beta version of our ZillaKranti Yojna or ZillaVikas Yojna

## Problem we are addressing
The problem is we need a Zilla Vikas platform where citizens can report problem surrounding them and citizens and government officials can interact easily by a single platform to check the fixation of the problem we can also track about the projects undergoing in the district.

## Solution
we are using E-mitra service platform in a mobile application where citizens goverment officials and higher authorities can directly interact with a particular district and theier problems citizens are facing, The user (Citizen, Goverment Official, or anyone) can report problems by using different ways of attaching pictures and video of the problem and goverment officials can work on the problem directly. This application shows status and updates regarding the work done.
If the upvotes for the particular problems increases to an N percente of population then a notification will be sent to higher authorities like CM and other ministries.

## Working Model
This app is haveing two interfaces User Interface and Admin interface
